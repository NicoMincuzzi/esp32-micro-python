## Prerequisites

### Install FTDI Drivers

To communicate with the ESP32, the *Thing board* has an FTDI FT231x USB-to-Serial chip. If you need to install the drivers, refer to our How to Install FTDI Drivers tutorial.
- To check if your driver is working, plug in your *ESP32 Thing* board into an available USB port (and make sure no other development boards or USB-to-Serial boards are plugged in).

On macOS, enter the command:

```sh
ls -l /dev/tty.usb*
```

Or on Linux, enter the command:

```sh
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
```

You should see a statement showing the existence of the `/dev/tty.usbserial` (or `/dev/ttyUSB0`) file. If you see `"No such file or directory,"` that means the driver was not installed. If you run into any issues with drivers in Linux or macOS, refer to the FTDI VCP drivers page for more information.

### Download the Latest MicroPython Firmware

Head to the MicroPython downloads page and download the latest "firmware for ESP32 boards." You will want the .bin file listed under standard firmware.

Update: This information appears to be outdated as the layout of the MicroPython website has changed. It has been suggested that users, now, use one of the "GENERIC: esp32-"blah-blah".bin" files listed under "Firmware built with ESP-IDF...".

(*As a heads up, we are not in control of the MicroPython webiste, so future changes may occur. Please, adapt as necessary for those changes.)

### Install Python üêç

To install MicroPython on the ESP32, we need to install full Python on our host machine. Weird, right? As it turns out, the esptool is a Python script that we'll run to upload the MicroPython interpreter to the ESP32.

Head to python.org and download the latest Python for your operating system. The esptool reportedly works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 (or newer). Follow the directions to install Python on your computer.

#### Install esptool

Open a command prompt and enter the following line:

```sh
$ pip install --upgrade esptool
```

The pip utility should automatically download and install esptool for you.

### üì∏ Flash MicroPython

Make sure your ESP32 is plugged into your computer. If you are on Windows, open the Device Manager and find out which COM port or device file your ESP32 is associated with (mine is COM7 as per the image above).

Before flashing the firmware to the ESP32, we'll want to erase everything in the chip's flash memory. To that, enter the following command (replace <USB-to-Serial Port> with your particular port name, such as COM7 on Windows, /dev/tty.usbserial-<letters and numbers> on macOS, or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux):

```sh
$ esptool.py --chip esp32 -p <USB-to-Serial Port> erase_flash
```
You should see some output explaining that the ESP32 has been erased and reset.

Erasing flash on the ESP32
Next, flash the firmware with the following command (replace <USB-to-Serial Port> with your particular port name, and replace <path to .bin> with the location of your downloaded firmware file, such as ~/Downloads/esp32-20180822-v1.9.4-479-g828f771e3.bin):

```sh
$ esptool.py --chip esp32 -p <USB-to-Serial Port> write_flash -z 0x1000 <path to .bin>
```
     
Once the firmware has been uploaded, you should see the message: "hash of data verified."

Uploading MicroPython to the ESP32
At this point, your ESP32 Thing should be running MicroPython.
     
### Test It

Download and install one of the many available serial terminal programs. If you are on Windows, open the Device Manager and find out which COM port your ESP32 Thing is associated with (for example, COM7). On macOS, it will likely be /dev/cu.usbserial-<some letters/numbers>, and on Linux, it‚Äôs probably something like /dev/ttyUSB0.

Open up your serial terminal program, and connect to your ESP32 Thing using the associated serial port and a baud rate of 115200. Press the enter key, and you should be presented with the MicroPython REPL command prompt (>>>). Enter the following commands:

```python
from machine import Pin
led = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
led.value(1)
```

This should turn on the LED attached to pin 5 on the ESP32 Thing board.

Turn on LED on ESP32 with MicroPython
To turn off the LED, enter the following command:
```python
led.value(0)
```

     
 ```sh
     cp temperature_sensor.py main.py
     ampy --port /dev/cu.usbserial-DN042779 put main.py
 ```
 `$  screen /dev/cu.usbserial-DN042779 115200`
     
After screen command you need to press RST button
